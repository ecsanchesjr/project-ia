# Comparação de técnicas utilizadas em algoritmos evolutivos para resolução do TSP
# Comparison of techniques used in evolutionary algorithms for TSP resolution

The project consists in implement various methods, based in evolutionary algorithm, to resolution of TSP. 

# Objective

Compare differents techniques and parameters used in evolutionary algorithm to analises the results obtained by him.
The article of project will be available after conclusion.

My apologies for the language of article is Portuguese-Brazil. 

# In comming

### For remember
* time information of each execution;
* print of best fitness after a X generations;
    * to generate graph;
    * comparison of convergency, number and time;
* print of best tour, with your fitness, when execution Done;
    * comparison of optima;
    * **MAYBE** graph with route;
* print of improvement of the population with generate method especial;
